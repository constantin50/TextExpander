# Windows Installer

You can download TextExp.exe and install it as common application. After installation, it needs to run
\dist\TextExp.exe. Note: some anti-virus software can treat installation as a danger but it is false positive
and there is no any virus.


Please feel free to contact me if have problems or questions.
